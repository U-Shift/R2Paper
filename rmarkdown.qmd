## What is R Markdown

R Markdown is a file format for creating dynamic documents.

It is an R extension of the popular Markdown format, commonly used for writing and formatting text on the web, and incorporates **R** and **Python** code for statistical analysis, visualizations, and data manipulation.

The Rmarkdown document contains the **text**, the **code** and the **results** (figures, tables, or inline calculations), ensuring the **analysis can be reproduced**.

It allows to produce different output formats from a single file to **one or more** formats:

-   **HTML**: Interactive and shareable reports.
-   **PDF**: Print-ready documents, using LaTeX.
-   **Word**: Editable reports `.docx`.
-   **Slides**: Presentation-ready content using frameworks like `xaringan` or `ioslides`.

## How it works

When you run `render`, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) which is responsible for creating the finished format.

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single `render` function.

## Example

1.  Create an `.Rmd` file in RStudio, and use HTML as output.

2.  Have a look at the template example and leave it as it is.

3.  Knit the document (click "Knit" in RStudio) to generate an output in the desired format.

Now, change it to pdf_document in the yaml

``` yaml
output: pdf_document
```

Open the ourput pdf.
