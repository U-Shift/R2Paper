1.  Create an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) and select an rticles template of your choice:

    -   Elsevier: Transportation Research Part A
    -   Springer: Lecture Notes in Computer Science
    -   Transportation Research Board (TRB)
    -   Taylor & Francis

2.  **Knit it first** to make sure any package is missing and the output looks fine

3.  Change your YAML document to include

    -   Your name
    -   Your affiliation and address
    -   Your e-mail

4.  Change your document to include the following chapters, using \## headings

    -   Introduction
    -   Literature review
    -   Methods
        -   Case Study
        -   Data collection
    -   Results
    -   Conclusions
        -   Further Research
    -   Funding
    -   References

5.  Make the Funding and References section as unnumbered, by pithing `{.unnumbered}` after the heading title

6.  Add the following to the abstract:

    > Urban mobility is a critical component of sustainable city development, influencing economic productivity, social equity, and environmental sustainability.
    > It encompasses the movement of people and goods within urban areas, integrating various modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, public transit, and private vehicles.
    > Effective urban mobility systems aim to ensure accessibility, affordability, and efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts and addressing the diverse needs of urban populations.
    >
    > In recent years, the rapid pace of urbanization has introduced complex challenges, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and inequitable access to transport options.
    > These issues disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as low-income residents, the elderly, and adolescents, highlighting the need for inclusive planning.
    > The emergence of innovative technologies, such as shared mobility platforms, autonomous vehicles, and smart city solutions, offers opportunities to reimagine urban transport networks.
    > However, successful implementation requires a balance between technological advancement, community engagement, and policy alignment.
    >
    > This paper explores the importance of integrating data-driven approaches, participatory planning, and sustainable policies to enhance urban mobility systems.
    > By prioritizing multimodal transportation, reducing dependency on private vehicles, and fostering equitable access to opportunities, cities can transition toward a more sustainable and resilient future.

7.  Count the words of the abstract and make sure that they are up to 200 words.

8.  Include the following papers as a references in the Literature Review section:

    -   <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2021.102734>
    -   <https://doi.org/10.1201/9780203730058>

9.  Include a table of contents

10. Make a cross-reference before a figure (pointing in the text to see Figure 1)

11. **Knit your pdf!**

12. Number lines

13. Make it a paper for `review`, instead of `preprint`

14. Make it `doubleblind`

15. **Knit your pdf again!**
