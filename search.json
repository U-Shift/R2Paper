It encompasses the movement of people and goods within urban areas, integrating various modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, public transit, and private vehicles. Effective urban mobility systems aim to ensure accessibility, affordability, and efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts and addressing the diverse needs of urban populations.\nIn recent years, the rapid pace of urbanization has introduced complex challenges, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and inequitable access to transport options. These issues disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as low-income residents, the elderly, and adolescents, highlighting the need for inclusive planning. The emergence of innovative technologies, such as shared mobility platforms, autonomous vehicles, and smart city solutions, offers opportunities to reimagine urban transport networks. However, successful implementation requires a balance between technological advancement, community engagement, and policy alignment.\nThis paper explores the importance of integrating data-driven approaches, participatory planning, and sustainable policies to enhance urban mobility systems. By prioritizing multimodal transportation, reducing dependency on private vehicles, and fostering equitable access to opportunities, cities can transition toward a more sustainable and resilient future.\n\nCount the words of the abstract and make sure that they are up to 200 words, using WordcountAddin.\nInclude the following papers as a references in the Literature Review section:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2021.102734\nhttps://doi.org/10.1201/9780203730058\n\nInclude a table of contents\nMake a cross-reference before a figure (pointing in the text to see Figure 1)\nKnit your pdf!\nNumber lines (linenumbers: true)\nMake it a paper for review, instead of preprint\nMake it doubleblind in classoption\nChange the biblio-style to elsarticle-num (you may need to remove authoryear from classoption)\nColor your citations in text\nKnit your pdf again!"

Click OK to convert when prompt.\n\n\n\nExample of this pdf book opened in MS Word\n\n\nMake some adjustments (sometimes it requires margins, spacing or line numbers), save it as .doc or .docx, and you are ready to go!\nNo headings, table of contents, citations, cross-references, figures, tables are missing."
