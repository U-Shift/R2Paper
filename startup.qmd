We can write a reproducible academic paper using R Studio, including your data, code, results and text.

You don't need to know everything by heart.
Starting with a pre-defined template from [rticles package](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/) is usually the best way to go.

See the examples of journal's templates at <https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html>

To use **rticles** from RStudio, you can access the templates through `File -> New File -> R Markdown`.
This will open the dialogue box where you can select from one of the available templates:

Let's start by choosing the Elsevier template, and provide a name to your paper (this will also be the name of the folder), for instance "ElsevierTemplate".

## References

If you type @ a citation manager will open with the list of your collection in your zotero librarty.

You can use other sources by going to Insert \> Citation...

Use the doi (**without the** https://doi.org/ **!!**) to search for a document that is not in your zotero library, and add it to your references.bib file directly.

## Citation Style Language

There are several standards to choose from when considering a Citation Style Language (**csl**).

[Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) offers a extensive list with examples, organized by journal name, and scientific fields.

If using a **csl**, just copy the link for the journal you are consider, and put it into your yaml[^startup-1].

[^startup-1]: You may need to make `citation_package: default`.
