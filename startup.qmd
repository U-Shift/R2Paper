We can write an academic paper using R Studio.

You don't need to know everything by heart.
Starting with a pre-defined template is usually the best way to go.

See the examples of journal's templates at <https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html>

To use **rticles** from RStudio, you can access the templates through `File -> New File -> R Markdown`.
This will open the dialog box where you can select from one of the available templates:

Let's start by choosing the Elsevier template, and provide a name to your paper (this will also be the name of the folder).
