## Cross-references

You can refer to sections, figures, tables, and equations in your document using the `@ref` syntax.

### With Sections

You can refer to sections like this `[Section 1](#Introduction)`.
This will show as "[Section 1](#Introduction)".

### With figures

You can refer to figures like this: `\@ref(fig:plot1)`.
This will show as "Figure [1]()".
For that, you need to add a label to the figure chunk, like this: `{#fig:plot1}`.
or `fig.cap="\label{plot1} Caption of the plot"` in your r chunk.

```{r plot1, out.width="100%", fig.cap="\\label{plot1} Caption of the plot"}
plot(cars)
```

### With tables

You can refer to tables like this: `\@ref(tab:table1)`.
This will show as "Table [1]()".
For that, you need to add a label to the table caption like this:

```{r table1}
# example with kable
knitr::kable(head(iris),
             caption = "\\label{table1}Caption of the table", # label here
             fotmat = latex,
             booktabs = TRUE)
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You don't need to use an ordered number, but just a name/label to your figures and tables.
R markdown will handle then the order of them and provide them **sequential numbering**.

## Create a table of contents

You can create a table of contents (**toc**) with the headings of your document, a list of tables (**lot**) or a list of figures (**lof**), simply by adding the following in the YAML:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Report"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2024-12-10"
output: pdf_document
toc: true
numbersections: true
number-depth: 3
lof: true
lot: true
---
```

## LaTeX packages

Sometimes, you need to use some LaTeX packages to customize your document.
To use those, you can add the following in the YAML:

``` yaml
preamble: |
  \biboptions{authoryear}
  \usepackage{url}
  \usepackage{pdflscape}
  \usepackage{float}
  \usepackage{booktabs}
  \usepackage{longtable}
  \usepackage{makecell}
  \usepackage{multirow}
```

## Converting to word `.doc`

It can be handful to convert your nice `.pdf` to a `.doc` file to send it to your supervisor, instead of a LaTeX or pdf file.

To do so, you can simply open your favorite word processor and open your pdf file inside.
Click OK to convert when prompt.

Make some adjustments (sometimes it requires margins, spacing or line numbers), save it as `.doc` or `.docx`, and you are ready to go!

No headings, table of contents, citations, cross-references, figures, tables are missing.

## Elsevier paper example

Example of a paper written in R Markdown and submitted in **pdf** and **LaTeX** for the Elsevier journal Computers, Environment and Urban Studies:\
